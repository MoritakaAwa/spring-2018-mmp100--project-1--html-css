<p><span class="text1">Hanyu apparently loves the Disney character Pooh bear and his supporters always throw the adorable bears onto the ice after he perform.
  There’s usually a Pooh sitting rinkside when he skates, and Hanyu will bow to or pat the bear’s head before competin.
  He sees Pooh as a good luck mascot.</span>
